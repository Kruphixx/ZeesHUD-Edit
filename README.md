### THIS HUD IS GROSSLY UNOPTIMIZED AND CAN TANK YOUR PERFORMANCE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# ZeesHUD
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI.
Originally made in late 2020 as a quarantine project and a 1k subscribers special to my channel.

It is no longer in active developement. As such, the creator will no longer provide any support. You are free to modify and tweak this HUD as your own.
